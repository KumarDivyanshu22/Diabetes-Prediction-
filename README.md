# Introduction-

In this notebook, we will explore using Bayesian Logistic Regression in order to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. The task is supervised - we are given labeled training data to fit our model - and it is a classification task because the lables are binary. Typically this is a task that is approached with supervised machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or tree based methods. We will take a slightly different approach and use a Bayesian Framework to fit a logistic regression model and then intrepret the resulting model parameters

# Diabetes-Prediction-

Predict whether or not the patient has diabetes. To accomplish this task, we will use a set of real-world data collected on females 21 years of age and over collected by a national health institution in the United States.
